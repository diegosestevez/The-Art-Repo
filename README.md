To see the production instance of the site please visit [theartrepo.netlify.app](https://theartrepo.netlify.app)

## Requirements for running locally
In order to run a local copy of The Art Repo locally you will require both an api and secret key from [CommerceJS](https://commercejs.com/). Items, prices and descriptions that appear in the home and shop sections of The Art Repo are unique to The Art Repo's own CommerceJS database. You will have to populate your own site with content using your own database from CommerceJS. Please create an account with CommerceJS prior to cloning this repo.

In order to faciliate credit card transactions from users you will need setup your own unique instance of the Stripe into your project. Please visit [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca) and create an account with them.

### Initializing React
The Art Repo is built on React Native therefore all of the standard react terminal commands apply. Before getting started it is recommended that you create a [react app from scratch](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
